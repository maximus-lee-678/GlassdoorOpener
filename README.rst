This program was developed in VS2022 using libcurl for Windows.
libcurl was installed using `vcpkg <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg>`_.

1. Get `latest <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases>`_ vcpkg zip file and extract it.
2. Open **Developer Command Prompt for VS** and cd to wherever vckpg has been extracted to.
3. Run:

.. code-block:: console

  bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

4. Run:

.. code-block:: console

  vcpkg.exe integrate install

5. Run:

.. code-block:: console

  vcpkg.exe install curl

OR

.. code-block:: console

  vcpkg.exe install curl --triplet=x64

6. After installation, in the project: ensure solution configuration (next to debug buttons) is targeting right triplet (x86 or x64).
